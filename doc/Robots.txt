
## Robot

    * A robot is the main entity in the simulation, having attributs and methodes.
    * We have 3 types of robots:
        * Social : A robot which is caracterized with its ability to interact with other other without any difficulties
            *  It is less stressed, more energetic and curious to discover other robots in the environemment.
        * Worker : A robot which is stressed by work - tasks that it tries to complete during its existance in the simulation.
            * More stressed and more energetic than others.
            * Now completes tasks, gains points, decreases stress after completion
            * Resigns when energy depletes or all tasks are completed
        * Explorer : A chill Robot... it is made just to discover and to share informations.
            * Chill , more curious and energetic to travel all around the environemment
            * Explores zones, shares zone information with other robots
            * Leaves simulation when all zones explored and curiosity depleted


## Behaviour 

    * Robot : 
        * It can move all around the environemment.
            - Mouvement is made according to the state of the robot 
                * A stressful robot tries to isolate itself and AVOID others.
                * An exhausted robot tries to rest in order to regain energy and continue to move.
                * A curious robot never stops exploring the environemment. 
        * It can interact in a certain way with other robots.
    
        > Social : Find a robot and try to interact with it 
            * Mouvement based on the position of other robots 
                - Acheive the closest robot to make an interact

                    > Sufficient energy

            * State updated with interactions it made.
                - Stress decreases after an interaction 
                - Curiosity increases with other robots.
                - Energy increases with others while it's decreasing with mouvement.

        > Worker : Focus on task completion
            * Behaviour:
                - Scan environment for pending tasks
                - Move towards nearest pending task
                - Complete task when within interaction distance
                - Gain points and decrease stress after completion
                - Increase curiosity after successful task completion
            
            * Resignation triggers:
                - When energy reaches 0
                - When all tasks in simulation are completed
                - Stops working and becomes inactive
            
            * Social Interaction:
                - When interacting with social robots
                - Transmit information about completed tasks
                - Share task knowledge

        > Explorer : Discover and explore zones
            * Behaviour:
                - Scan environment for exploration zones
                - Visit zones within exploration distance
                - Mark zones as visited and record in personal history
                - Build knowledge of zone locations
            
            * Zone Management:
                - Track all visited zones
                - Record which zones have been explored
                - Share zone information during social interactions
            
            * Leave Mechanism:
                - When ALL zones are explored: set wantsNewEnvironment = true
                - When curiosity reaches 0: immediately wants to leave (leaveAttempts++)
                - When curiosity < 10 AND energy < 30: also wants to leave
                - Once decided to leave, generates leaveAttempts counter
            
            * Curiosity Loss:
                - Loses EXPLORER_CURIOSITY_LOSS (10) points when all zones explored
                - Eventually reaches 0 if exploring nothing new
                - 0 curiosity triggers immediate leave signal


## Simulation Completion Logic

    * The simulation ends when specific conditions are met based on robot composition:

        1. WORKERS ONLY (No Explorers/Social):
            - All tasks must be completed
            - All workers automatically resign
            - Simulation ends after minimum 10 steps

        2. EXPLORERS ONLY (No Workers/Social):
            - All zones must be visited
            - All explorers set leaveAttempts = 1 (want to leave)
            - Simulation ends after minimum 10 steps

        3. MIXED ROBOTS (Workers + Explorers + Social):
            All three conditions MUST be met:
            - ALL workers have resigned
              (either energy = 0 OR all tasks completed)
            - ALL explorers have leaveAttempts > 0
              (triggered when curiosity = 0)
            - ALL social robots have 0 connected robots
              (no successful interactions completed)
            - AND simulation has run for > 10 steps

    * Debug Output:
        - Shows which completion conditions are satisfied when ending
        - Displays reason for each robot type's state
        - Total steps executed during simulation
