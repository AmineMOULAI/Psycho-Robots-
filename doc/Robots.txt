
## Robot

    * A robot is the main entity in the simulation, having attributs and methodes.
    * We have 3 types of robots:
        * Social : A robot which is caracterized with its ability to interact with other other without any difficulties
            *  It is less stressed, more energetic and curious to discover other robots in the environemment.
        * Worker : A robot which is stressed by work - tasks that it tries to complete during its existance in the simulation.
            * More stressed and more energetic than others.
        * Explorer : A chill Robot... it is made just to discover and to share informations.
            * Chill , more curious and energetic to travel all around the environemment


## Behaviour 

    * Robot : 
        * It can move all around the environemment.
            - Mouvement is made according to the state of the robot 
                * A stressful robot tries to isolate itself and AVOID others.
                * An exhausted robot tries to rest in order to regain energy and continue to move.
                * A curious robot never stops exploring the environemment. 
        * It can interact in a certain way with other robots.
    
        * Social : Find a robot and try to interact with it 
            * Mouvement based on the position of other robots 
                - Acheive the closest robot to make an interact

            * State updated with interactions it made.
                - Stress decreases after an interaction 
                - Curiosity increases with other robots.
                - Energy increases with others while it's decreasing with mouvement.
