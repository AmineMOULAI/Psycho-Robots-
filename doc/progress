    * Automating compilation with Makefile
        * Makefile structure 
            - Define Variables
            - Create source/objects files and run object separatly 
            - `make` to compile
            - `make start` to execute the program
            - Compilation of src files
            - Compilation of run.cpp file
            - `make clean` to clean obj and bin files
            
        

## 19/11/2025

    * Create Robot class (Abstract Class)
        * Create social, worker and explorer
    * Create simulation class

##  24/11/2025
    * Correct some bugs 
    * Complete simulation class
    * Add Zone class (Task and ExplorationZone)
    * Add enum for robot, task status, zone status 

##  29/11/2025
    * Create Simulation Robots, Tasks and Exploration Zone 
    * Display the state of simulation

## 30/11/2025
    * Move the Robots randomly, without purpose, in 4 directions (N, S, E, W)
    * Update movement, add 4 directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW)

## December updates
    * Manage energy in movement for Robot
    * Add a rest time for Robot and energy renewal
    > Social Logic 
        * Add target concept to communicate with other Robots
            * Analyse the environnement, sort targets and select a robot based on some criteria.
        * Connect Social with others via CALL/RESPONSE Protocol
            * Add states to Robots and state for Call
            * Add CALL functionnality for Social and RESPONSE mecanisme to all ALL Robots.
            * handle CALL/RESPONSE Protocol 

## January 3, 2026 - Worker Logic Implementation
    > Worker Logic Completed
        * Task completion system
            - Workers find and move to nearest pending tasks
            - Complete tasks when at task location
            - Gain 10 points per completed task
            - Consume 10 energy per task completion
        * Stress & Curiosity Management
            - Stress decreases by 15 after task completion
            - Curiosity increases by 5 after task completion
            - Stats clamped to 0-100 range
        * Resignation Mechanic
            - Workers resign when energy reaches 0
            - Can also be forced to resign when all tasks completed
        * Social Interaction
            - Workers share task knowledge with social robots
            - Special interaction messages for info transmission

    > Explorer Logic Enhanced
        * Zone exploration
            - Track explored zones
            - Visit unvisited zones within distance threshold
        * Leave mechanism
            - Explorers want new environment after exploring all zones
            - Auto-leave when curiosity reaches 0
            - Track leave attempts to prevent spamming
            - Leave conditions: (wantsNewEnvironment AND curiosity == 0) 
                              OR (wantsNewEnvironment AND curiosity < 10 AND energy < 30)

    > Simulation Completion System
        * Edge Case 1: Workers Only
            - If all tasks completed → workers resign → simulation ends
        * Edge Case 2: Explorers Only
            - If all zones visited → explorers want to leave → simulation ends
        * Normal Case: Mixed Robots
            - All workers must resign
            - All explorers must want to leave
            - All social robots must have 0 interactions (no successful calls)
            - Minimum 10 steps required to ensure simulation runs
        * Debug Output
            - Shows completion conditions when simulation ends
            - Tracks reason for worker resignation/explorer leave

    > Bug Fixes
        * Stats clamping: All robot stats (stress, energy, curiosity) clamped to 0-100
        * Explorer premature exit: Added stricter conditions to prevent early leave
        * Worker auto-resign: Now resigns when all tasks done (not just when energy depletes)
        * Exploration completion: All zones visited forces explorer to want to leave
